# Reconstruction of Regulatory Networks using Learning Methods

In this project we have dealt with the reconstruction of regulatory networks using machine learning. 
We have reconstructed networks in unsupervised as well as supervised way. This repository consists of 
the scripts associated with the project. For unsupervised learning, we have used methods like lasso with stability
selection and tree based models like Random Forests, Extra Trees and Gradient Boosting. \\
For supervised learning, we have used methods from the literature concerning graph based learning like 
local classification models and matrix factorization to integrate global knowledge. \\
We also tried out deep learning architectures to learn the latent state of the cell.
